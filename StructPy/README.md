Here are the things I should develop ASAP

# Initialization
- use networkX framework to initialize things (watch out that this should be a directed graph)
- Get the adjacency matrix
- Define the inputs, outputs, measurements, and disturbances and use coloring to resolve it
- find a nice way to print out stuff at the same time
- compute basic things such as diameter of the graph, degree distribution, etc.


# Bipartite GrapH
- Build a 2nd graph from the original graph which represents the bipartite graph


# Advanced Algorithms
- Use the virus spread algorithm to check the strong structural controllability (check with numerics)
- Highlight the seperating sets
- Highlight the linkings
- Highlight the frontiers
- Measure the minimum number of required sensors
- Compute the Estrada's GoodExpansion measure


# The experiments
- For a scale free network: (compare the Estrada's measure with size of seperating set)
